## Hi! Welcome to`/Data_Structures_Learning`!

#### So youre probably wondering what this repository is for.

To be completely honest, I have no clue either. I am pretty well versed in most common data structures, so im going to use this repostitory to do some practice design and maybe make some of my own funky datastructures. If this is the first repo you see from my account, i am so sorry. Go check out some of my other projects!
